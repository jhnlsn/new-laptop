Stuff that I do when I get a new laptop, usually a macbook pro or similar

So many things to do when you get a new laptop and I just want to remember them all in one place without having to go somewhere else.  I'm pretty random so these things are in no particular order.  All steps outlined are for a MB Pro.  If you develop for the web on anything else, well I'm sorry please talk to your respective manager and let him know you will be quitting soon.

# Desktop Software

I'm so indecisive when it comes to writing stuff down and then I get all hung up on the formatting instead of getting the information down. `do I want to do this in a list or headlines... sigh`  I know that good content > formatting but what ever I'm a little OCD so what ever.

## Desktop apps

1. [Iterm](https://www.iterm2.com) - Because terminal is too boring.  Not a whole lot more to say here.
1. [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com) - as of this writing, jetbrains just redid their website.  I guess they wanted to get all fancy and actually do care about formatting lol.  I write a lot of javascript so this is usually what I need.
1. [atom](https://atom.io) - Great for general text editing and other simple stuff when you don't need a whole lot of other cruft that goes along with jetbrains IDE stuff.  Currently writing this readme in atom :)
1. [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com) - you know what to do.  buy it.  Plus interestingly, their website is not https.
1. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) - if you don't listen to music while you code, then I don't know what to tell you.
1. [1password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) - I don't care what sort of password manager you use, but use one kids.  Don't use drugs and the same password on all of your websites!  Pick one or the other or something like that!


# Docker

This is going to need its own section because there is a lot going on here.  Need to be generic though since the instructions will probably change down the road.
